# AMAZON-CLONE

# Hey!! Guys
Amazon Clone webpage created using CSS ,HTML.

I have created Amazon clone using HTML,CSS . The site can be accesssed by opening the Index.html file and running it in VS CODE. It is very similar to original website of amazon.

The CSS is used for Designing the component of the Website.  

The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
